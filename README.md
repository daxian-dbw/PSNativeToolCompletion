# PSNativeToolCompletion

This PowerShell module enables lazy loading of argument completion scripts for native commands.
It leverages the new 'fall-back' completer for native commands -- `Register-ArgumentCompleter -NativeFallback` (introduced in PowerShell v7.6).

When tab completion is triggered for a native command, it checks for a corresponding completion script,
loads and registers it on-demand, and then provides completions.
It minimizes startup overhead and only loads completion logic as needed.

## Managing Completion Scripts

The module exposes two functions to help you manage completion scripts for native commands:

### `Add-CompletionScript`

Adds or updates a completion script for a native command.
The script will be stored in `~/.pwsh/completions/` with the naming convention `__<command>.ps1`.

**Syntax:**

```powershell
Add-CompletionScript -Command <string> -InputScript <string>
```

- `-Command`: The name of the native command (e.g., `docker`, `kubectl`, `gh`)
- `-InputScript`: The completion script content (accepts pipeline input)

**Examples:**

Add a completion script generated by a native tool:
```powershell
docker completion powershell | Add-CompletionScript -Command docker

kubectl.exe completion powershell | Add-CompletionScript -Command docker

gh completion -s powershell | Add-CompletionScript -Command gh
```

### `Get-CompletionScript`

Lists completion scripts that have been added to the module's completion directory.

**Syntax:**

```powershell
Get-CompletionScript [[-Command] <string[]>]
```

- `-Command`: Optional. One or more command names to filter by. If omitted, lists all completion scripts.

**Examples:**

List all completion scripts:
```powershell
Get-CompletionScript
```

Get completion script(s) for specific command(s):
```powershell
Get-CompletionScript docker
Get-CompletionScript docker, kubectl, gh
```

View the content of a completion script:
```powershell
Get-CompletionScript kubectl | Get-Content
```

## Installing latest version from main

### Prerequisites

1. The `PSResourceGet` module is installed.
2. A `SecretVault` is created called `default`.

### Instructions

#### Setup a PAT to read the feed.

Create a [Personal Access Token (Classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with `package:read` permission.
At the time of writing, this is the only type of token that allows these premissions.

```powershell
## The command should prompt for the secret.
Set-Secret -Name GitHubPackageRead
```

Register the Repository.
This assumes you called you vault `default` as described in the prerequisites.

```powershell
Register-PSResourceRepository `
    -name daxian-dbw `
    -uri https://nuget.pkg.github.com/daxian-dbw/index.json `
    -ApiVersion V3 `
    -CredentialInfo @{ VaultName='default'; SecretName='GitHubPackageRead' } `
    -Trusted
```

Then, you can install the module:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name PSNativeToolCompletion -Repository daxian-dbw
```
